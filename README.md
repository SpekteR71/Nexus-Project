# Nexus-Project
Breast Cancer Prognosis prediction based on a patient's clinical and genomic data. Machine Learning algorithms such as KNN, RF, SVM, LR were used in this project.
A thorough data preprocessing and analysis was also done before training the models.

Here is a comparison between the algorithms.
